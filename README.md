# React + Vite

This project is built using **React** and **Vite**, providing a minimal setup with HMR (Hot Module Replacement) and ESLint rules for code quality.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Assignment Details

This project was an **assignment** by EduCase India where I was tasked with:

- Creating a **4-page website** based on a **Figma design**.
- Ensuring the website is **mobile responsive** and works across different device sizes.

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
